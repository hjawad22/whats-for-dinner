# What's for Dinner? 

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
I developed a user-friendly application that enables users to choose their preferred dish type and surprises them with a recommended food item. One exciting feature of this app is that users can even receive suggestions for an entire meal to prepare. This resolves the challenge of making choices from a broad range of options, freeing users from the burden of deciding what to cook. By aiding users in making a decision, this application eases the stress of decision-making.
